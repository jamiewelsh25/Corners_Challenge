## Football Corner Distribution Model

### Overview

In response to the challenge of predicting corner distributions in football matches, this project introduces a robust mathematical model. The model is designed to determine the distribution of total corners in football matches by leveraging a comprehensive training set. By incorporating various features, such as historical corner data for both home and away teams, as well as league-specific corner statistics, the model aims to provide accurate predictions. The .ipynb file contains all the code used to train the model as well as some exploratory data analysis while the .pdf file outlines my approach in more detail.

### Key Features

* Training Set: The model is trained on a training set encompassing macth data from football matches from several different leagues from 2005-2010.
* Distribution Assumption: The model assumes a specific distribution for corners, taking into account historical data and patterns related to corner kicks.
* Probabilistic Predictions: For each match in the provided test set - which has data for 2011 football matches along with betting lines, the model generates probabilities for the total number of corners falling under, at, or over a given line.
